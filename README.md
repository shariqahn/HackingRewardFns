# Hacking Black-Box Reward Functions

This project aims to improve an agent's returns during meta-reinforcement learning by allowing the agent to have access to the reward function in the given environment. We are using OpenAI's Gym library to create custom environments for testing.

Research is conducted by Shariqah Hossain and Tom Silver.
